## 📁 Assets Folder

This directory contains project-related static resources used across the application. These files support documentation, UI components, and visual demonstrations.

### Contents

* **Images** — Logos, diagrams, UI screenshots, and visual references.
* **GIFs** — Short demonstrations and animations for documentation.
* **Icons** — Small graphical assets used in the interface.
* **Miscellaneous** — Any additional static resources required by the project.

### Guidelines

* Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard_overview.png`, `api_flow.gif`).
* Avoid storing sensitive information, API keys, or configuration files.
* Optimise image sizes where possible to keep the repository lightweight.
* Organise assets into subfolders if the collection grows.

### Usage

Assets in this directory may be referenced by:

* Project READMEs
* Frontend components
* Documentation or tutorials
* Deployment previews or demos
